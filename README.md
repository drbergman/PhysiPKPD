Congratulations! You're ready to try out PhysiPKPD!

## Running the sample projects
There are 6 sample projects currently distributed with PhysiPKPD.
There is one for each supported Mechanism of Action (MOA), one combination treatment, and one that starts therapy after a confluence condition is met.
To run one of these samples, do the following:

1. `make reset` to make sure you have the newly edited Makefile in your top directory
2. Make your preferred sample project:
    * `make pkpd-proliferation-sample` 
    * `make pkpd-apoptosis-sample` 
    * `make pkpd-necrosis-sample` 
    * `make pkpd-motility-sample` 
    * `make pkpd-combo-sample`
    * `make pkpd-confluence-start-sample`
3. Compile your model: `make`
4. Run your model
   * On Mac: `./pkpd_sample ./config/pkpd_model.xml`
   * On Windows: `pkpd_sample.exe ./config/pkpd_model.xml`
5. Look at the snapshots in `output/` and the living cell counts in `output/cell_counts.csv`

<!-- ## Reconfiguring, editing, and re-running
**Note:** *While the below functionality is present, it is discouraged because it is likely to inadvertently affect the work of others.
Instead, it is recommended to instead save any changes to these files in a non-tracked directory and manually copy them into their proper places after `make`-ing the sample project.*

Instead of editing the configuration file copied into `PhysiCell/config/pkpd_model.xml`, you can choose to edit the original in `PhysiCell/sample_projects_physipkpd/[project_name]/config/pkpd_model.xml` to save the changes for future runs.
The command `make rc` will reconfigure from the original `pkpd_model.xml` to facilitate editing in the latter fashion.

Similarly, you can edit the custom modules in `PhysiCell/sample_projects_physipkpd/[project_name]/custom_modules/` to save changes for future runs.
After making these changes, you can run `make redo` and this will automatically move those changes to their proper places and recompile the project. -->

## Setting parameters
PhysiPKPD parameters are found in two areas in `pkpd_model.xml`: PK parameters are at the bottom in `user_parameters` and PD parameters are in `cell_definitions` in the `custom_data` for each cell type.
PhysiPKPD can add PK and/or PD dynamics to any substrates in a PhysiCell simulation.
PK dynamics must be set for each PK substrate.
PD dynamics must be set for each pairing `(S,C)` where substrate `S` acts on cell type `C`.
PhysiPKPD will attempt to use defaults if none are supplied and issue warnings/errors until you have fully specified everything.

In what follows, `S` stands for the name of a substrate, `C` stands for the name of a cell type, and `X` stands for a MOA.

### PK and PD substrates
You can specify which substrates you want to include PK dynamics.
You can do the same for PD dynamics.
These lists can be set independently of one another so that every PhysiCell substrate can have PK, PD, both, or neither.
The parameters in the following table are those PhysiPKPD will use to define which substrates follow PK and PD dynamics.
Add them to `user_parameters`.
Omitting `PKPD_pk_substrate_names` will result in no PK dynamics and similarly for the PD dynamics.
PhysiPKPD will use the comma-separated values in these parameters to search for the relevant PK/PD parameter names.

| Parameter | Description |
|:--|---|
| `PKPD_pk_substrate_names` | Comma-separated list of substrates also following PK dynamics |
| `PKPD_pd_substrate_names` | Comma-separated list of substrates also producing PD dynamics in some cells |
<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> Identifying PK and PD substrates
</p>

PhysiPKPD will issue a warning if it finds a name in either of these lists that is not a substrate.
Watch the initial output closely!
Example:
```
<PKPD_pk_substrate_names type="string">myDrug,myDrug_no_PD</PKPD_pk_substrate_names>
<PKPD_pd_substrate_names type="string">myDrug,myDrug_no_PK</PKPD_pd_substrate_names>
```
In the above example, `myDrug` and `myDrug_no_PD` will follow PK dynamics.
In addition, `myDrug` and `myDrug_no_PK` will lead to PD effects for any cell type with `S_moa_is_X` set to `1.0` (see [below](#pd_pars)).

**Note:** Avoid spaces!

### PK parameters <a name="pk_pars"></a>
There are three PK models to choose from.
To specify which one `S` uses, set `S_pk_model` according to Specification below.

**Note:** To use an SBML-defined PK model, you must have libRoadRunner installed.
If you can run the `sample_projects_intracellular/ode` projects, you are ready to run these PhysiPKPD models.

| Model | Description | Specification |
| :-- | :-- | :-: |
| 1-compartment | Circulation compartment with linear elimination | `1C` |
| 2-compartment | `1C` plus a periphery compartment with linear intercompartmental clearance rates | `2C` |
| SBML-defined | Any SBML-defined model. Place the file in the `./config/` folder. PhysiPKPD will look for the species named `circulation_concentration` to use for updating Dirichlet nodes | `SBML` |
<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> PK model specifications
</p>

If `S_pk_model` is not set, PhysiPKPD will default to a 2-compartment model[^oldpk]:

[^oldpk]: For those using the simplified 2-compartment model that PhysiPKPD used to use, see the [`S_flux_across_capillaries`](#old_flux_par) entry in the table.

$$
\begin{aligned}
C' & = \frac{k_{21}}{R}P - k_{12}C - \lambda C \\
P' & = k_{12}RC - k_{21}P
\end{aligned}
$$

For all PK models, a Biot number should be specified.
This describes the ratio of substrate concentration just outside capillary walls to that inside the blood vessel.
It can be related to a reflection coefficient.

| Parameter | Type | Description | If Missing |
| :-- | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| `S_biot_number` | `double` | Ratio of substrate concentration on boundary of microenvironment (Dirichlet condition) and concentration in systemic circulation | Set to `1.0` |

#### Non-SBML models

For each substrate following `1C` or `2C`, you can set the following parameters in `user_parameters`.
For example, a substrate called `myDrug` with 10 doses administered would have the following in `user_parameters`: 

```
<myDrug_max_number_doses type="int">10</myDrug_max_number_doses>
```

| Parameter | Type | Description | If Missing |
| :-- | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| `S_read_dose_schedule_from_csv`[^dose_csv] | `bool` | If true, ignore the following parameters and read in a dosing schedule from `./config/S_dose_schedule.csv` | Set to `False` |
| `S_max_number_doses` | `int` | Total number of doses to give including loading doses | Set to `0` |
| `S_number_loading_doses` | `int` | Number of loading doses to give before switching to regular doses | Set to `0` |
| `S_dose_interval` | `double` | Time between successive doses, loading or regular (in minutes) | If `S_max_number_doses`>1, throws an error |
| `S_central_increase_on_dose` | `double` | Increase in concentration in central compartment after a regular dose | If `S_max_number_doses`>`S_number_loading_doses`, throws an error |
| `S_central_increase_on_loading_dose` | `double` | Increase in concentration in central compartment after a loading dose | If `S_number_loading_doses`>0, throws an error |
| `S_set_first_dose_time` | `bool` | Boolean determining if the first dose time is fixed or if a confluence condition will be used to determine the first dose time | Set to `False` |
| `S_first_dose_time` | `double` | Time of first dose if given at fixed time (in minutes) | Set to `current_time` |
| `S_confluence_condition` | `double` | Proportion of microenvironment filled with cells at which to give first dose; confluence calculated by sum of cross-sectional area of all cells divided by area of microenvironment | Never check confluence condition |
<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> Dosing parameters

[^dose_csv]: The CSV file for a dosing schedule must have the dosing times (in minutes) in the first column and the dose amounts in the second column.
No header row should be included.

| Parameter | Type | Description | If Missing |

| `S_periphery_to_central_clearance_rate` $(k_{21})$ | `double` | Rate of change in concentration in periphery compartment due to redistribution (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) | Set to `S_flux_across_capillaries` $\times$ `S_central_to_periphery_volume_ratio`, if present. Otherwise, set to `0` |
| `central_to_periphery_volume_ratio` $(R = V_1/V_2 = V_C/V_P)$ | `double` | Ratio of central compartment to periphery compartment *for any substrates without a specific volume ratio as above* | Set to `1` |
| `S_flux_across_capillaries`<a name="old_flux_par"></a> | `double` | **Consider using the above parameters to quantify intercompartmental clearance rates.**[^1] Rate of change in concentration in central compartment due to distribution and redistribution (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) | See above |
<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> PK parameters
</p>

[^1]: To use these two parameters, you will want to set $k_{12}$ as your original flux rate and $k_{21}$ as `S_flux_across_capillaries * S_central_to_periphery_volume_ratio`.

#### SBML-defined models

You must supply a user parameter with the name of the SBML file:

| :-- | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| `S_sbml_filename` | `string` | Filename of SBML file, e.g. `PK_default.xml` | Set to `PK_default.xml` |

Place this file in the `./config/` folder.
You must specify dosing events yourself in SBML files.

#### PhysiCell PK parameters

You can also set the following parameters in `microenvironment_setup` for each substrate:
| Parameter | Description |
| :--| --- |
| `diffusion_coefficient` | Diffusion rate in the microenvironment |
| `decay_rate` | Rate of decay in the microenvironment |

</p>

### PD parameters <a name="pd_pars"></a>
The PD dynamics in PhysiPKPD work by the target cell type accumulating damage over time due to internalized substrate.
Thus, for each (substrate, cell type)-pairing, a PD model must be specified.
There are two models for this currently implemented in PhysiPKPD: damage accumulates based on either concentration or amount of the internalized substrate.
By default, PhysiPKPD will assume concentration is being used.
To specify this model, create a string parameter called `S_on_C_pd_model` with value selected from the following table:

| Model | Description | Specification |
| :-- | :-- | :-: |
| Concentration-based | Damage accumulates based on internal concentration | `AUC`[^auc] |
| Amount-based | Damage accumulates based on internal amount | `AUC_amount` |

<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> PD model specifications
</p>

[^auc]: Area under the curve (AUC) is a common metric in pharmaceutical sciences measuring the extent of exposure to a substance.

Let us know if you would like to see a different PD model included.
Unlike PK dynamics, integration with SBML solvers is not implemented.

#### Damage Accumulation Parameters <a name="dam_pars"></a>
For both of the above models, the cell type, `C`, affected by substrate `S` accumulates damage, $D$, based on the internalized substrate, $A$.
The equation is unchanged if $A$ is measured in amount or concentration.
This accumulation of damage obeys the following differential equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A' & = -mA \\
D' & = A - r_1D - r_0
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that since damage is an abstract quantity, we do not include a rate parameter as a coefficient for $A$ in the equation for $D'$.
Each of these parameters **should** be set[^old_repair].
If they are not set, PhysiPKPD will issue a warning and set them to 0.
These parameters go in the `custom_data` of `C`.

[^old_repair]: For backwards compatibility, `S_repair_rate` can be set instead of `S_repair_rate_constant`.

|Parameter|Description|
|:--|---|
| `S_damage` $(D)$ | Not a parameter; data that tracks the current damage to the cell |
| `S_repair_rate_constant` $(r_0)$ | Zero-order elimination rate of damage from `S` (in damage per minute) |
| `S_repair_rate_linear` $(r_1)$ | First-order elimination rate of damage from `S` (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `S_metabolism_rate` $(m)$ | Rate of elimination of `S` from inside a cell (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) |

<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> Damage accumulation parameters <a name="dam_pars_table"></a>
</p>

By default, PhysiPKPD uses the `mechanics_dt` set in the configuration file to determine how often to update these dynamics.
You can change this by adding a user parameter of the format `S_dt_C`.
For example, if you wish to use a timestep of `0.01` for updating the damage of `myDrug` on `tumor`, then add the following to `user_parameters`:

```
<myDrug_dt_tumor type="double">0.01</myDrug_dt_tumor>
```

#### Cell Effect Parameters
The accumulated damage then affects the cell through one or more mechanisms of action (MOA).
These MOAs are specified by setting `S_moa_is_X` to `1.0` in `custom_data`.
Currently, PhysiPKPD supports the following MOAs: `prolif`, `apop`, `necrosis`, or `motility`.
Replace `X` with the corresponding one of these you wish for your MOA.
For example, a substrate called `myDrug` causing a proliferation effect would have the following in `custom_data` for the affected cell:

```
<myDrug_moa_is_prolif>1.0</myDrug_moa_is_prolif>
```

MOAs that are not present in `custom_data` are assumed off.
*Beware of typos!*

For each MOA, the damage is input into a Hill-type function so that the effect eventually saturates.
These parameters also go in `custom_data`, but if any are omitted for an active MOA, PhysiCell will relentlessly spam the standard output.
The effect is applied to whatever the *current* relevant rate for the cell is.
This way, you can easily add these PD effects on top of other effects already present in your model.
Just take care that before calling `pd_phenotype_function` within `update_phenotype` that the affected rate is reset to the base value lest PhysiPKPD compound these effects each time.
See the sample projects targeting `proliferation`, `apop`, and `necrosis`.
If you target `motility`, do the same but within `custom_cell_rule` before calling `pd_custom_function`.

|Parameter|Description|
|:--|:--|
| `S_moa_is_X` | Used as boolean to determine which effects to apply to this cell type based on the damage from `S`; values > 0.5 will apply the effect |
| `S_X_saturation_rate` | Rate of `X` as damage from `S` approaches infinity |
| `S_X_EC50` | Damage from `S` at which the rate of `X` is halfway between the base and saturation rates (in damage) |
| `S_X_hill_power` | Hill coefficient for calculating the effect of `S` on the rate of `X` |

<p align="center">
    <b>Table:</b> Cell effect parameters
</p>

In the event that multiple substrates have the same MOA for a given cell type, PhysiPKPD combines their effects multiplicatively.
That is, PhysiPKPD internally uses the `S_X_saturation_rate` and the associated base rate for the given `Cell_Definition` to compute a saturation factor.
The value of the Hill-type function then determines the magnitude of the applied factor for that substrate.
All of these factors are multiplied and finally multiplied to the *current* rate for the given cell.
In the case of necrosis, however, it is our experience that most models assume a base necrosis rate of `0`, which would result in divide-by-zero errors in this formulation.
Instead, we choose to add up the effects rather than computing and then multiplying the factors.
This can be illustrated with an example:

##### Example: MOA targeted by multiple substrates
Cell `C` of type `CD` is targeted by `S1` and `S2`, both with an `apop` MOA on `CD`.
Currently, `C` has damages `S1_damage` and `S2_damage` from `S1` and `S2`, respectively.
Using the distinct EC50s and Hill powers for `S1` and `S2` on `C`, these Hill-type functions output $h_1 = 0.25$ and $h_2=0.5$ for `S1` and `S2`, respectively.
These values can be interpreted as `S1` causing a quarter of its maximal effect on `C` and `S2` causing half its maximal effect on `C`.

Now, suppose that the saturation effects on `C` are `1E-3` $\text{min}^{-1}$ and `1E-2` $\text{min}^{-1}$ for `S1` and `S2`, respectively.
The base apoptosis rate for `CD` is `1E-5` $\text{min}^{-1}$.
Then, `S1` and `S2` have saturation factors of $f_{\text{sat},1} = 10^{-3} / 10^{-5} = 100$ and $f_{\text{sat},2} = 10^{-2} / 10^{-5} = 1000$, respectively.
These can be interpreted as the substrates causing up to a 100-fold and 1000-fold, respectively, increase in the apoptosis rate of `C`.

Thus, the factor change from `S1` is $f_{\text{sat},1} \cdot h_1 = 25$; from `S2` it is $f_{\text{sat},2} \cdot h_2 = 500$.
The total factor change applied to the apoptosis rate for `C` is then $25\cdot 500 = 12,500$.
Finally, this is multplied to the *current* apoptosis rate for `C`.
If other aspects of the model cause `C` to deviate from the base apoptosis rate of `CD`, then PhysiPKPD honors these.
If, for example the current apoptosis rate of `C` is not `1E-5` but instead `1E-6` perhaps because it is in a quiescent niche, then PhysiPKPD will update its apoptosis rate to $12,500 \cdot 10^{-6} = 0.0125\ \text{min}^{-1}$.

### Miscellaneous parameters
The following are user parameters that provide some control over how the dynamics are solved.
Currently, all (non-SBML) PK and PD models implemented in PhysiPKPD are readily solved using analytic techniques.
By informal observation, the analytic methods are not slower than numerical methods.
If anything the analtyic methods are faster.
Therefore, all simulations use analytic solutions.

To maximize the efficiency of these analytic solutions, many terms are pre-computed ahead of time.
**However**, if the parameters governing your PD dynamics vary&mdash;e.g., due to heterogeneity within the affected cell type&mdash;then you will not want to do pre-computations.
You can include the following as Booleans in `user_parameters` to control this.
For example, if a substrate `myDrug` affects cell type `tumor` and you want to pre-compute the PD quantities, include the following in `user_parameters`:

```
<myDrug_precompute_pd_for_tumor type="bool">True</myDrug_precompute_pd_for_tumor>
```

|Parameter|Type|Description| If Missing |
|---|:-:|---|:--|
| `PKPD_precompute_all_pd_quantities` | `bool` | Boolean to determine the default behavior for pre-computations for *all* PD dynamics | Set to `True` |
| `S_precompute_pd_for_C` | `bool` | Boolean to override default behavior for a single (substrate, cell type) pairing; **turn this off if PD parameters can vary within this cell type OR if your PD time step is not a multiple of your `diffusion_dt`** | No effect |

## Making your own project using PhysiPKPD
If you wish to make your own project that uses PhysiPKPD (and not just one of the pre-built sample projects), this is how you can proceed.
1. Make one of the PKPD template projects: `make pkpd-template` or `make pkpd-template-sbml`
2. Edit the configuration file to set the Dirichlet conditions, [PK Parameters](#pk_pars), and [PD Parameters](#pd_pars) for the two PKPD substrates and the default cell type `cell`.
3. Add additional substrates as normal (using the Model Builder for this is untested)
4. Add additional cell types as normal (using the Model Builder for this is untested).
5. By default, each cell type is assigned the same `update_phenotype` function, which is `cell_phenotype` found in the `custom.cpp` file.
Add new phenotype functions as desired for each cell type.
6. Notice that the `update_phenotype` function resets the three MOA-targeted rates before calling `pd_phenotype_function`.
7. By default, each cell type is assigned the same `custom_cell_rule` function, which is `custom_function` found in the `custom.cpp` file.
8. Notice that the `custom_cell_rule` function resets the migration speed before calling `pd_custom_function`.

**Note:** The order in which PhysiCell updates the various aspects of a cell matters!
For example, intracellular updates happen first.
So, if those intracellular updates affect proliferation, apoptosis, or necrosis rates, then resetting those rates in your `update_phenotype` function will erase those changes.
Similarly, `custom_cell_rule` is called after `update_phenotype` and prior to `update_velocity`, and `update_velocity` in turn calls `update_migration_bias`.
Thus, changes to migration speed in `update_phenotype` or from an intracellular model would be erased if `custom_cell_rule` resets migration speed.
Resetting the migration speed in `update_migration_bias` erases the PD effects calculated in `custom_cell_rule`.
