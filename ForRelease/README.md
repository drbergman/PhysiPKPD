# PhysiPKPD
## Getting Started
1. Download the folder with all the contents (as of this writing it is called `ForRelease`) (you probably already did that and that's how you found this README!)
2. Move the folder `PhysiPKPD` into `PhysiCell/addons/`
3. Move the folder `sample_projects_phsyipkpd` into `PhysiCell`
4. Open `PhysiCell/sample_projects/Makefile-default` (the one that `make reset` will will put in the main PhysiCell directory)
5. Add the text from `Makefile-PhysiPKPD_Addendum` to `PhysiCell/sample_projects/Makefile-default` (anywhere should work, perhaps best around line 195 at the end of the other sample projects)

Congratulations! You're ready to try out PhysiPKPD!

## Running the samples
There are 5 sample projects currently distributed with PhysiPKPD.
There is one for each supported Mechanism of Action (MOA) and one combination treatment.
To run one of these samples, do the following:

1. `make reset` to make sure you have the newly edited Makefile in your top directory
2. Make your preferred project:
    * `make moa_proliferation` 
    * `make moa_apoptosis` 
    * `make moa_necrosis` 
    * `make moa_motility` 
    * `make combo`
3. Compile your project: `make`
4. Run your project: `./project ./config/mymodel.xml`
5. Look at the snapshots in `output/` and the living cell counts in `output/cell_counts.cvs`

## Reconfiguring, editing, and re-running
You can edit the configure file to change parameter values.
You can either edit the one copied in `PhysiCell/config/mymodel.xml` or edit the original in `PhysiCell/sample_projects_physipkpd/[project_name]/config/mymodel.xml` to save the changes for future runs.
The command `make rc` will reconfigure from the original `mymodel.xml` to facilitate editing in the latter fashion.

Should you choose to edit any of the files in `PhysiCell/sample_projects_physipkpd/[project_name]/custom_modules/`, you can afterwards run `make redo` and this will automatically move those changes to their proper places and recompile the project.

## Varying parameters
PhysiPKPD parameters are largely concentrated in two areas in `mymodel.xml`: PK parameters are at the bottom in `user_parameters` and PD parameters are in `cell_definitions` in the `custom_data` for each cell type.
PhysiPKPD comes hardcoded with two drugs and neither can be excluded. Of course, you can set them so that there are no doses or that doses result in no increase to the drug concentration.
PK dynamics must be set for each drug and PD dynamics determined for each cell type for each drug.

### PK parameters
For each drug, you can set the following parameters in `user_parameters`:

| Parameter | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| `PKPD_D1_number_loading_doses` | Number of loading doses to give before switching to regular doses |
| `PKPD_D1_max_number_doses` | Total number of doses to give including loading doses |
| `PKPD_D1_dose_interval` | Time between successive doses, loading or regular (in minutes) |
| `PKPD_D1_set_first_dose_time` | Boolean determining if the first dose time is fixed or if a confluence condition will be used to determine the first dose time |
| `PKPD_D1_first_dose_time` | Time of first dose if given at fixed time (in minutes) |
| `PKPD_D1_confluence_condition` | Proportion of microenvironment filled with cells at which to give first dose; confluence calculated by sum of cross-sectional area of all cells divided by area of microenvironment
| `d1_color_ec50` | If `damage_coloring` is used for plotting, this sets the damage from drug 1 that causes half the maximum redshift in the cell cytoplasm |
| `d1_color_hp` | If `damage_coloring` is used for plotting, this is the Hill coefficient used to calculate the amount of redshift in the cytoplasm |
| `d2_color_ec50` | If `damage_coloring` is used for plotting, this sets the damage from drug 2 that causes half the maximum blueshift in the cell nucleus |
| `d2_color_hp` | If `damage_coloring` is used for plotting, this is the Hill coefficient used to calculate the amount of blueshift in the nucleus |
| `PKPD_D1_central_increase_on_loading_dose` | Increase in concentration in central compartment after a loading dose |
| `PKPD_D1_central_increase_on_dose` | Increase in concentration in central compartment after a regular dose |
| `PKPD_D1_central_elimination_rate` | Elimination rate in central compartment (in mintues<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `PKPD_D1_flux_across_capillaries` | Rate of change in concentration in central compartment due to distribution and redistribution (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `PKPD_D1_biot_number` | Ratio of drug concentration on boundary of microenvironment (Dirichlet condition) and concentration in systemic circulation |
|`central_to_periphery_volume_ratio` | Ratio of central compartment to periphery compartment to determine effects of distribution and redistribution on periphery |

You can also set the following parameters in `microenvironment_setup` for each drug:
| Parameter | Description |
| ---| --- |
| `diffusion_coefficient` | Diffusion rate in the microenvironment |
| `decay_rate` | Rate of decay in the microenvironment |

As of now, there is only one way for the drug to enter the microenvironment: through the ymin boundary.
Thus, do not change the `Dirichlet_options` without also changing `PK_model` in `PhysiCell/addons/PhysiPKPD/src/PhsyiPKPD.cpp`.

### PD parameters
For each cell type, all of the PD parameters are in `custom_data` for each cell type.
In the table below, `X` can stand for any one of `prolif`, `apop`, `necrosis`, or `motility`.
|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
| `PKPD_D1_moa_is_X` | Used as boolean to determine which effects to apply to this cell type based on the damage from drug 1; values > 0.5 will apply the effect |
| `PKPD_D1_X_saturation_rate` | Rate of `X` as damage from drug 1 approaches infinity |
| `PKPD_D1_X_EC50` | Damage from drug 1 at which the rate of `X` is halfway between the base and saturation rates (in damage) |
| `PKPD_D1_X_hill_power` | Hill coefficient for calculating the effect of drug 1 on the rate of `X` |
| `PKPD_D1_damage` | Not a parameter; data that tracks the current damage to the cell |
| `PKPD_D1_repair_rate` | Zero-order elimination rate of damage from drug 1 (in damage per minute) |
| `PKPD_D1_metabolism_rate` | Rate of elimination of drug 1 from inside a cell (in minutes<sup>-1</sup>) |
